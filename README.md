# FloppyBat
Floppy Bat is a fun and challenging game inspired by the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird", with custom graphics, sounds, and physics. Written in Python using the Pygame library, this project was not only created for entertainment purposes, but also served as a learning experience for me. Give "Floppy Bat" a try and see how many points you can score!

INSTRUCTIONS:
------------

1- Unzip the file on your computer

2- Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system

3- Ensure that the Pygame module is installed. This can be done using pip. 
   Documentation on how to use pip to download pygame is available here: 
   https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

3- Run Floppybat.py by double clicking it (If python is set to open these
   files by default), by using the command line or terminal, or by using 
   your favorite IDE/Advanced text editor

4- Press any key to make your bat flap! avoid the oncoming pipes and try
   to earn a high score. Game will automatically reset when you lose.
